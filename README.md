# Coordinationbar

This Datapack shows your coordinations above your hotbar.
This means you dont have to press the `F3` key any more in order to read your position from this cramped overlay.

It also shows you wich direction your facing including the angle.

The `/trigger coordbar_menu` command opens a menu in chat that allows you to seperatly turn on/off your position and rotation!

The update rate can be set in `data/coordbar/functions/config`.
